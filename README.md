# High-precision Ellipse Fitting via Multi-scale Smoothing and Key-point Searching

we proposed a novel preprocessing module composed of multi-scale smoothing and key-point searching for high-precision ellipse fitting.

## Compile the codes

Due to the portability of python codes, we can directly compile it in windows system and Linux system.
The codes are developed by pycharm2018. Main.py is the main program.
